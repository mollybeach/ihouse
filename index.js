94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Easy
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Example 4:
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 5:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,2]

Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 */

var inorderTraversal = function(root) {

};
inorderTraversal([1, null, 2, 3])
